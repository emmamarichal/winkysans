## Setting up your font

### New repositories


5. Fill out `documentation/DESCRIPTION.en_us.html` with a description about your font.

9. **Set up your GitHub pages site**: go to Settings > Pages and ensure that the "Source" drop-down is set to "Deploy from a Branch". Ensure that the "Branch" is set to `gh-pages`. If this branch is not available, check that the "Build font and specimen" action in the "Actions" tab has completed; if it completed successfully, then try again - `gh-pages` should now be an option.

10. If Github Actions has successfully built the family, you will find the font binaries in the Actions tab. The official Github Actions documentation provides further [information](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts).

Description of your font goes here. We recommend to start with a very short presentation line (the kind you would use on twitter to present your project for example), and then add as much details as necesary :-) Origin of the project, idea of usage, concept of creationâ€¦ but also number of masters, axes, character sets, etc.

Don't hesitate to create images!

## About

typofactur is a German foundry run by the graphic designer Simon Atzbach.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://typofactur.github.io/winkysans.git.
